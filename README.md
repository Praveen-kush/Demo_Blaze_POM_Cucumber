* Locators: Contains classes for element locators implementing the Page Object Model.
* StepDefinitions: Houses step definitions linked to feature files.
* Resources: Includes configuration files for reporting (ExtentReports, YAML, XML).
* TestRunners: Contains the TestRunners.java file to execute tests.


# Test Scenarios
The following scenarios are covered in this project:

* Sign-Up Functionality
  Verify that a user can successfully sign up on the DemoBlaze website.

* Add Products
  Validate that products can be added to the cart.

* Cart Functionality
